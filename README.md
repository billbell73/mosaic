This was a learning project, done in order to help me get a better understanding of Go.

This project owes a debt to [Sau Sheong Chang](https://github.com/sausheong) who set a similar [Go challenge](https://twitter.com/golangchallenge) and blogged about it [here](https://blog.saush.com/2015/06/24/creating-a-photo-mosaic-web-app/)
