This app creates photo mosaics from uploaded photos. The mosaic "tiles" are 700 resized images from one of the instagram accounts of [National Geographic](https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/), hosted on AWS s3.

This was a learning project, done in order to help me get a better understanding of Go. It owes a debt to [Sau Sheong Chang](https://github.com/sausheong) who set a similar [Go Challenge](https://twitter.com/golangchallenge) and blogged about it [here](https://blog.saush.com/2015/06/24/creating-a-photo-mosaic-web-app/).
